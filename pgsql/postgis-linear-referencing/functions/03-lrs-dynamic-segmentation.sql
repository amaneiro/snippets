-- The test will be done by creating a new geom field in events table
-- representing the localization of point in the route (events_point)
-- or the dynamic segmentation from the route (events_line).

-- create routes: calibrate line by setting the ends
UPDATE public.routes AS r1 SET the_geom = (
       SELECT ST_AddMeasure(the_geom, measure_start, measure_end)
       FROM public.routes AS r2
       WHERE r1.id_route = r2.id_route
);

-- locate points along routes
UPDATE events_point AS p1 SET the_geom = (
       SELECT ST_Locate_Along_Measure(r.the_geom, p2.measure)
       FROM public.routes AS r, public.events_point AS p2
       WHERE p1.id_route = p2.id_route AND r.id_route = p2.id_route
);

-- create dynamic segments from routes
